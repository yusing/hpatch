# File scope and lifecycle

## REQ-FILE-001 — File scope and lifecycle

An invocation has one immutable baseline for each touched existing file. The first
`in PATH` loads the regular UTF-8 contents visible at invocation start and makes that
logical file active. Returning to the same logical file reuses that baseline and retains
its pending edits. There are no generations and no command can materialize pending
content as a new target baseline inside the script.

`new PATH` creates and activates a pending empty file. It fails if the logical path
exists in the invocation workspace or pending state. Its immediately following nonblank
command may be one targetless `type VALUE` initializer; any intervening command closes
that initialization opportunity. The initializer is consumed even when its value is
empty. No target-bearing mutation is valid on a new file because no invocation baseline exists
for it. Further or dependent content changes require a successful invocation. A later invocation
may use exact authored current text as an unanchored literal target; a fresh read is required only
when exact current content is unknown or ambiguous.

`mv PATH` moves the active logical file to an unoccupied pending path. The destination
becomes active; its original baseline and pending edits move with it. Later `in` resolves
the new path, not the old one. Repeated moves collapse to one original-to-final move.

`rm` marks the active existing file deleted and clears the active file. Removing an
existing file after any content mutation in the same invocation is an edit conflict;
pending content is never silently discarded. Removing a moved, otherwise unedited file
deletes its invocation-original path. Removing a file created in the same invocation
cancels that creation, including an empty initializer.

`in` fails for missing or deleted paths. `mv` and `rm` fail without an active file.
`new` and `mv` fail on destination collision. Parents of `new` and `mv` destinations must
already exist. Hpatch does not create directories. All file and content changes remain
in memory until the complete invocation crosses the apply or translation boundary.

Acceptance:

1. A script can edit multiple files and return to an earlier path without shifting that
   file's targets or losing pending disjoint edits.
2. A new file accepts at most one immediately following targetless initializer and does
   not expose introduced content as a same-script target.
3. Moves preserve baseline identity and pending edits; repeated moves collapse to one net
   action.
4. Removal after an existing-file content mutation, path collision, use after deletion,
   unsupported target-bearing new-file edits, and lifecycle commands without an active
   file reject before external mutation or patch output.
5. Failure or cancellation after any number of commands exposes no intermediate change.
